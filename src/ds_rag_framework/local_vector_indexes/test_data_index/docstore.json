This content didn't help me. PrintYou are here: PermissionsThe permissions allows you to manage user access to HealthRules Payer actions (such as view, create, and amend), claims processing actions, reports, message codes, accounts, and products.Permissions are assigned to groups and not users. Permissions are always granted (not restricted) in a group and are additive as you move down the chain of hierarchical groups. In other words, the more groups you belong to, the more permissions (greater access) you have. Users inherit permissions from the group to which they belong. When a user does not have permission for a feature, the system hides or disables that part of the application.There are two types of permissions:Direct Permissions: These are permissions set up within a group. You can change these permissions from within the group record.Indirect Permissions: These are inherited from other groups and are also known as inherited permissions. Inherited permissions cannot be viewed or changed in a group record and can be changed only by going directly to the group record in the hierarchy that contains the permissions.When upgrading HealthRules Payer applications, new permissions (typically added to support new features) are assigned only to the \"hcc_super_user\" group. You need to specifically assign any new permissions included in the upgrade to the other appropriate group or groups. Also, if you add or change permissions while the applications are in use, you must restart the application before the permission changes take effect.The table below describes the permission categories available in HealthRules.Permission TypeDescriptionType Action PermissionsDefines which actions are permitted (view, create, amend, etc.) for a document type (account, subscription, supplier, etc.) by the group members (see \"Appendix A: Permission Sets\").Claim Processing PermissionsDefines the claim actions permitted (view, enter, reprocess, review, repair, etc.) for the members of the group. You can vary the permissions for selected claim actions by the claim sources listed below (see \"Creating a Group\").AdjustInput \u2014 This permission grants the ability to open a finalized claim for edit.AdjustOutput \u2014 This permission grants the ability to adjust financials on a finalized claim.Review \u2014 This permission grants the ability to open a claim in a review state to edit and adjust the financials. It also allows the user to deny the claim and approve review conditions (further controlled by message code permissions).Repair \u2014 This permission grants the ability to open a claim in a repair state to edit or reject a claim.Void \u2014 This permission grants the ability to manually void a claim that should never have existed. For more information, see the Vol. 8: Claims chapter in the HealthRules Payer Manager\u2019s Guide.Replace \u2014 This permission grants the ability to replace a previously entered claim with incorrect or missing information.You can also set the claim reprocessing override permission (allow or disallow) and the maximum amount group members can approve to pay on a claim from the Claim Review and Repair Workbasket. Message Code PermissionsDefines the message codes that members of the group have permission to work. The members of the group can access the transactions associated with the selected message codes in the workbaskets to review or repair.This can be all codes for every message type or a specific message type and code combination.Override Denial Message Code PermissionsDefines the denial message codes members of the group can manually override or add to a claim line.Group Access PermissionsDefines the permissions to access member-related data in a unit within a line of business (LOB). These include carriers, business segments, accounts, or products.Sensitive Data PermissionsDefines the attributes protected by sensitive data rules that the members of the group can access. The sensitive data rules apply to subscription, membership, claim or service authorization attributes and are defined via the sensitive data rule setting in HealthRules Designer.For example, if a sensitive data rule is defined for member salary amounts or social security numbers, then you must grant access to the field by assigning this permission to view the actual value, or else the value is masked and cannot be viewed.ID Restriction PermissionsDefines the document types where the ID cannot be entered or edited manually. When applied to the following document types, the system will automatically generate the ID based on the ID generation rules and be read-only.Subscription ID\u00a0/Member ID Account IDSupplier ID Practitioner IDService Authorization ID Supplier Location IDPractitioner Role NameClaim IDNote: This permission type differs from other permission types in that it prevents users from taking action, while other permission types allow an action.Report PermissionsDefines the HealthRules Answers reports members of the group can view or execute.Advanced PermissionsDefines the following special advanced permissions the members of the group have.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5221, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "957bb9e3-3bf7-46ca-bf44-83eec95a0d04": {"__data__": {"id_": "957bb9e3-3bf7-46ca-bf44-83eec95a0d04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Permissions", "url": "https://helpcenter.healthedge.com/24.1hrp/Content/AdminConsole-Topics/Introduction/permissions.htm", "version": "24.1", "section_summary": "The key topics of the section are permissions in the HealthRules Payer system.

VIP permissions \u2014 This allows members of the group to view records flagged as VIP records using the hierarchical structure described below. Users without VIP permission cannot search or view any records with VIP restrictions.Account \u2014 Sub-accounts automatically inherit VIP permissions from the parent account. Therefore, if the VIP\u00a0restriction is for the account document type and the user has the VIP\u00a0permission, the user can view all sub-account, subscription, and member records flagged as VIP.Account \u2014 Sub-accounts automatically inherit VIP permissions from the parent account. Therefore, if the VIP\u00a0restriction is for the account document type and the user has the VIP\u00a0permission, the user can view all sub-account, subscription, and member records flagged as VIP.Trusted User Permission  \u2014 Allows members of the group to interact between HealthRules Payer and HealthRules Portal/third-party products. Typically, only the groups \u201cportal_group\u201d and \u201chcc_integration_group\u201d have this permission.Note: This should only be granted to the portal_group (see \"Required HealthRules Users and Groups\").Supervisor group permissions  \u2014 Allows members of these groups the ability to assign or multi-assign items to a workbasket. Note that the supervisor permission also automatically grants users VIP permission.Answers Publishing Wizards permissions \u2014 For Answers 2.X only, it specifies whether group members can use the HealthRules Answers publishing wizard to upload, configure and delete custom reports. For more information see the HealthRules Answers User Guide.Note: The Answers Publishing function is for Answers 2.X only. Answers 3.X does not use this function.Tips about permissionsHere are some key points to remember when working with permissions:Always write down and model your group/permissions hierarchy on paper (or in a tool like Visio) before creating groups and permissions in HealthRules Payer \u2014 you need to think through the overall structure before creating groups. Example The following illustration shows how permissions are granted to users in an additive fashion as they are inherited through a hierarchy of groups:The above graphic illustrates how the permission hierarchy can be visualized as an inverted (upside down) organizational chart. As you move down the hierarchy more and more permissions are granted to more senior roles (fewer users), which require fuller access to the system.VIP permissions and Group Access Account permissions inherit permissions from the top account in the top account-sub account structure. As a result, if a member has access to a record in a top account but not at the subaccount level, the member can view the record from the top account. Please note that this inheritance does not apply to Workbasket Assignment Exclusion permissions.Example The following illustration shows how the HealthRules system uses a hierarchical structure to grant VIP\u00a0permissions to users. For example, since VIP\u00a0permissions are at the top-account level, members in that account inherits the same VIP\u00a0permissions. Therefore, if a user is assigned VIP\u00a0permissions, the user can view VIP\u00a0records from account level to the member level. The top-level permission always overrides the lower level permissions. Therefore in the following example, if VIP\u00a0permissions are also set on the subscription B, members of that subscription will still inherit VIP permissions from the top account. Groups with access to the  top account, business segment, or carrier can access the documents related to the sub-accounts.Permissions always grant access to an application or feature (the only two exceptions are the ability to limit Carrier, Business Segment, Account or Product access).Basic permissions should be granted to the top-level group/groups. The Single Permission group in the diagram below depicts how basic permissions are granted.Permissions are additive, meaning that as the hierarchical chain of groups gets long, more and more permissions are granted. Because permissions are always additive from one group to another, there are no overriding or superseding permissions from lower-level to higher-level groups.Permissions are always granted to groups, not individual users. A user must belong to a group or groups to have permission.Groups inherit permissions when they are members of other groups.Inherited permissions cannot be viewed or changed.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4586, "end_char_idx": 9608, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24402b67-31f7-4c1c-9ef1-f8c97d134880": {"__data__": {"id_": "24402b67-31f7-4c1c-9ef1-f8c97d134880", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Permissions", "url": "https://helpcenter.healthedge.com/24.1hrp/Content/AdminConsole-Topics/Introduction/permissions.htm", "version": "24.1", "section_summary": "The key topics of the section are permissions and groups in the HealthRules Payer application.

Example The following illustration shows how permissions are granted to users in an additive fashion as they are inherited through a hierarchy of groups:The above graphic illustrates how the permission hierarchy can be visualized as an inverted (upside down) organizational chart. As you move down the hierarchy more and more permissions are granted to more senior roles (fewer users), which require fuller access to the system.VIP permissions and Group Access Account permissions inherit permissions from the top account in the top account-sub account structure. As a result, if a member has access to a record in a top account but not at the subaccount level, the member can view the record from the top account. Please note that this inheritance does not apply to Workbasket Assignment Exclusion permissions.Example The following illustration shows how the HealthRules system uses a hierarchical structure to grant VIP\u00a0permissions to users. For example, since VIP\u00a0permissions are at the top-account level, members in that account inherits the same VIP\u00a0permissions. Therefore, if a user is assigned VIP\u00a0permissions, the user can view VIP\u00a0records from account level to the member level. The top-level permission always overrides the lower level permissions. Therefore in the following example, if VIP\u00a0permissions are also set on the subscription B, members of that subscription will still inherit VIP permissions from the top account. Groups with access to the  top account, business segment, or carrier can access the documents related to the sub-accounts.Permissions always grant access to an application or feature (the only two exceptions are the ability to limit Carrier, Business Segment, Account or Product access).Basic permissions should be granted to the top-level group/groups. The Single Permission group in the diagram below depicts how basic permissions are granted.Permissions are additive, meaning that as the hierarchical chain of groups gets long, more and more permissions are granted. Because permissions are always additive from one group to another, there are no overriding or superseding permissions from lower-level to higher-level groups.Permissions are always granted to groups, not individual users.

This content didn't help me. PrintYou are here: PermissionsThe permissions allows you to manage user access to HealthRules Payer actions (such as view, create, and amend), claims processing actions, reports, message codes, accounts, and products.Permissions are assigned to groups and not users. Permissions are always granted (not restricted) in a group and are additive as you move down the chain of hierarchical groups. In other words, the more groups you belong to, the more permissions (greater access) you have. Users inherit permissions from the group to which they belong. When a user does not have permission for a feature, the system hides or disables that part of the application.There are two types of permissions:Direct Permissions: These are permissions set up within a group. You can change these permissions from within the group record.Indirect Permissions: These are inherited from other groups and are also known as inherited permissions. Inherited permissions cannot be viewed or changed in a group record and can be changed only by going directly to the group record in the hierarchy that contains the permissions.When upgrading HealthRules Payer applications, new permissions (typically added to support new features) are assigned only to the \"hcc_super_user\" group. You need to specifically assign any new permissions included in the upgrade to the other appropriate group or groups. Also, if you add or change permissions while the applications are in use, you must restart the application before the permission changes take effect.The table below describes the permission categories available in HealthRules.Permission TypeDescriptionType Action PermissionsDefines which actions are permitted (view, create, amend, etc.) for a document type (account, subscription, supplier, etc.) by the group members (see \"Appendix A: Permission Sets\").Claim Processing PermissionsDefines the claim actions permitted (view, enter, reprocess, review, repair, etc.) for the members of the group. You can vary the permissions for selected claim actions by the claim sources listed below (see \"Creating a Group\").AdjustInput \u2014 This permission grants the ability to open a finalized claim for edit.AdjustOutput \u2014 This permission grants the ability to adjust financials on a finalized claim.Review \u2014 This permission grants the ability to open a claim in a review state to edit and adjust the financials. It also allows the user to deny the claim and approve review conditions (further controlled by message code permissions).Repair \u2014 This permission grants the ability to open a claim in a repair state to edit or reject a claim.Void \u2014 This permission grants the ability to manually void a claim that should never have existed. For more information, see the Vol. 8: Claims chapter in the HealthRules Payer Manager\u2019s Guide.Replace \u2014 This permission grants the ability to replace a previously entered claim with incorrect or missing information.You can also set the claim reprocessing override permission (allow or disallow) and the maximum amount group members can approve to pay on a claim from the Claim Review and Repair Workbasket. Message Code PermissionsDefines the message codes that members of the group have permission to work. The members of the group can access the transactions associated with the selected message codes in the workbaskets to review or repair.This can be all codes for every message type or a specific message type and code combination.Override Denial Message Code PermissionsDefines the denial message codes members of the group can manually override or add to a claim line.Group Access PermissionsDefines the permissions to access member-related data in a unit within a line of business (LOB). These include carriers, business segments, accounts, or products.Sensitive Data PermissionsDefines the attributes protected by sensitive data rules that the members of the group can access. The sensitive data rules apply to subscription, membership, claim or service authorization attributes and are defined via the sensitive data rule setting in HealthRules Designer.For example, if a sensitive data rule is defined for member salary amounts or social security numbers, then you must grant access to the field by assigning this permission to view the actual value, or else the value is masked and cannot be viewed.ID Restriction PermissionsDefines the document types where the ID cannot be entered or edited manually. When applied to the following document types, the system will automatically generate the ID based on the ID generation rules and be read-only.Subscription ID\u00a0/Member ID Account IDSupplier ID Practitioner IDService Authorization ID Supplier Location IDPractitioner Role NameClaim IDNote: This permission type differs from other permission types in that it prevents users from taking action, while other permission types allow an action.Report PermissionsDefines the HealthRules Answers reports members of the group can view or execute.Advanced PermissionsDefines the following special advanced permissions the members of the group have.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5221, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae719625-21fe-4982-8f8b-0a43d9030cda": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae719625-21fe-4982-8f8b-0a43d9030cda", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Permissions", "url": "https://helpcenter.healthedge.com/24.1hrp/Content/AdminConsole-Topics/Introduction/permissions.htm", "version": "24.1", "section_summary": "The key topics of the section are permissions in the HealthRules Payer system.

This content didn't help me. PrintYou are here: PermissionsThe permissions allows you to manage user access to HealthRules Payer actions (such as view, create, and amend), claims processing actions, reports, message codes, accounts, and products.Permissions are assigned to groups and not users. Permissions are always granted (not restricted) in a group and are additive as you move down the chain of hierarchical groups. In other words, the more groups you belong to, the more permissions (greater access) you have. Users inherit permissions from the group to which they belong. When a user does not have permission for a feature, the system hides or disables that part of the application.There are two types of permissions:Direct Permissions: These are permissions set up within a group. You can change these permissions from within the group record.Indirect Permissions: These are inherited from other groups and are also known as inherited permissions. Inherited permissions cannot be viewed or changed in a group record and can be changed only by going directly to the group record in the hierarchy that contains the permissions.When upgrading HealthRules Payer applications, new permissions (typically added to support new features) are assigned only to the \"hcc_super_user\" group. You need to specifically assign any new permissions included in the upgrade to the other appropriate group or groups. Also, if you add or change permissions while the applications are in use, you must restart the application before the permission changes take effect.The table below describes the permission categories available in HealthRules.Permission TypeDescriptionType Action PermissionsDefines which actions are permitted (view, create, amend, etc.) for a document type (account, subscription, supplier, etc.) by the group members (see \"Appendix A: Permission Sets\").Claim Processing PermissionsDefines the claim actions permitted (view, enter, reprocess, review, repair, etc.) for the members of the group. You can vary the permissions for selected claim actions by the claim sources listed below (see \"Creating a Group\").AdjustInput \u2014 This permission grants the ability to open a finalized claim for edit.AdjustOutput \u2014 This permission grants the ability to adjust financials on a finalized claim.Review \u2014 This permission grants the ability to open a claim in a review state to edit and adjust the financials. It also allows the user to deny the claim and approve review conditions (further controlled by message code permissions).Repair \u2014 This permission grants the ability to open a claim in a repair state to edit or reject a claim.Void \u2014 This permission grants the ability to manually void a claim that should never have existed. For more information, see the Vol. 8: Claims chapter in the HealthRules Payer Manager\u2019s Guide.Replace \u2014 This permission grants the ability to replace a previously entered claim with incorrect or missing information.You can also set the claim reprocessing override permission (allow or disallow) and the maximum amount group members can approve to pay on a claim from the Claim Review and Repair Workbasket. Message Code PermissionsDefines the message codes that members of the group have permission to work. The members of the group can access the transactions associated with the selected message codes in the workbaskets to review or repair.This can be all codes for every message type or a specific message type and code combination.Override Denial Message Code PermissionsDefines the denial message codes members of the group can manually override or add to a claim line.Group Access PermissionsDefines the permissions to access member-related data in a unit within a line of business (LOB). These include carriers, business segments, accounts, or products.Sensitive Data PermissionsDefines the attributes protected by sensitive data rules that the members of the group can access. The sensitive data rules apply to subscription, membership, claim or service authorization attributes and are defined via the sensitive data rule setting in HealthRules Designer.For example, if a sensitive data rule is defined for member salary amounts or social security numbers, then you must grant access to the field by assigning this permission to view the actual value, or else the value is masked and cannot be viewed.ID Restriction PermissionsDefines the document types where the ID cannot be entered or edited manually. When applied to the following document types, the system will automatically generate the ID based on the ID generation rules and be read-only.Subscription ID\u00a0/Member ID Account IDSupplier ID Practitioner IDService Authorization ID Supplier Location IDPractitioner Role NameClaim IDNote: This permission type differs from other permission types in that it prevents users from taking action, while other permission types allow an action.Report PermissionsDefines the HealthRules Answers reports members of the group can view or execute.Advanced PermissionsDefines the following special advanced permissions the members of the group have.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5221, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22d29c6a-4778-451f-8fde-dc6ffe799e0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "22d29c6a-4778-451f-8fde-dc6ffe799e0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Permissions", "url": "https://helpcenter.healthedge.com/24.1hrp/Content/AdminConsole-Topics/Introduction/permissions.htm", "version": "24.1", "section_summary": "The key topics of the section are permissions in the HealthRules Payer system.

Therefore, if the VIP\u00a0restriction is for the account document type and the user has the VIP\u00a0permission, the user can view all sub-account, subscription, and member records flagged as VIP.Account \u2014 Sub-accounts automatically inherit VIP permissions from the parent account. Therefore, if the VIP\u00a0restriction is for the account document type and the user has the VIP\u00a0permission, the user can view all sub-account, subscription, and member records flagged as VIP.Trusted User Permission  \u2014 Allows members of the group to interact between HealthRules Payer and HealthRules Portal/third-party products. Typically, only the groups \u201cportal_group\u201d and \u201chcc_integration_group\u201d have this permission.Note: This should only be granted to the portal_group (see \"Required HealthRules Users and Groups\").Supervisor group permissions  \u2014 Allows members of these groups the ability to assign or multi-assign items to a workbasket. Note that the supervisor permission also automatically grants users VIP permission.Answers Publishing Wizards permissions \u2014 For Answers 2.X only, it specifies whether group members can use the HealthRules Answers publishing wizard to upload, configure and delete custom reports. For more information see the HealthRules Answers User Guide.Note: The Answers Publishing function is for Answers 2.X only. Answers 3.X does not use this function.Tips about permissionsHere are some key points to remember when working with permissions:Always write down and model your group/permissions hierarchy on paper (or in a tool like Visio) before creating groups and permissions in HealthRules Payer \u2014 you need to think through the overall structure before creating groups. Example The following illustration shows how permissions are granted to users in an additive fashion as they are inherited through a hierarchy of groups:The above graphic illustrates how the permission hierarchy can be visualized as an inverted (upside down) organizational chart. As you move down the hierarchy more and more permissions are granted to more senior roles (fewer users), which require fuller access to the system.VIP permissions and Group Access Account permissions inherit permissions from the top account in the top account-sub account structure. As a result, if a member has access to a record in a top account but not at the subaccount level, the member can view the record from the top account. Please note that this inheritance does not apply to Workbasket Assignment Exclusion permissions.Example The following illustration shows how the HealthRules system uses a hierarchical structure to grant VIP\u00a0permissions to users. For example, since VIP\u00a0permissions are at the top-account level, members in that account inherits the same VIP\u00a0permissions. Therefore, if a user is assigned VIP\u00a0permissions, the user can view VIP\u00a0records from account level to the member level. The top-level permission always overrides the lower level permissions. Therefore in the following example, if VIP\u00a0permissions are also set on the subscription B, members of that subscription will still inherit VIP permissions from the top account. Groups with access to the  top account, business segment, or carrier can access the documents related to the sub-accounts.Permissions always grant access to an application or feature (the only two exceptions are the ability to limit Carrier, Business Segment, Account or Product access).Basic permissions should be granted to the top-level group/groups. The Single Permission group in the diagram below depicts how basic permissions are granted.Permissions are additive, meaning that as the hierarchical chain of groups gets long, more and more permissions are granted. Because permissions are always additive from one group to another, there are no overriding or superseding permissions from lower-level to higher-level groups.Permissions are always granted to groups, not individual users. A user must belong to a group or groups to have permission.Groups inherit permissions when they are members of other groups.Inherited permissions cannot be viewed or changed.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4586, "end_char_idx": 9608, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51b97968-734f-434a-b6b2-cbb6b1b0431b": {"__data__": {"id_": "51b97968-734f-434a-b6b2-cbb6b1b0431b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Permissions", "url": "https://helpcenter.healthedge.com/24.1hrp/Content/AdminConsole-Topics/Introduction/permissions.htm", "version": "24.1", "section_summary": "The key topics of the section are permissions and groups in the HealthRules Payer application.

You can also apply payables across sub-accounts and billing categories. You can allocate the payments partially to the outstanding balances and allocate one payment towards multiple outstanding balances. The system appropriately tracks section-level and plan-level allocations. If your healthcare company has an administrative policy requiring a binder payment before a subscription can become active, you can record the binder payment here. Note that if the payment is a binder payment (the first premium payment ever for the plan selection, or the first premium payment after a break in coverage), the system will compare the Payment Amount to the Bill Amount. If the Bill Amount is not entered, or it is entered and is greater than the Payment Amount, the system will not change the subscription status to \"Active.\" Only if the Bill Amount is entered, and is less than or equal to the Payment Amount, will the subscription status be set to \"Active.\"For binder payments, HealthRules does not add multiple payments received to determine if the combined total equals the Bill Amount.
